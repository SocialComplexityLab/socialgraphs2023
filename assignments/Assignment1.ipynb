    "# Part 1: Binning degree distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Binning real numbers\n",
    "  * Let's do a gentle start and use the `random` library generate 5000 data points from a Gaussian distribution with $\\mu = 2$ and $\\sigma = 0.125$.\n",
    "  * Now, let's use `numpy.histogram` to bin those number into 10 bins. What does the `numpy.histogram` function return? Do the two arrays have the same length?\n",
    "  * Then we use `matplotlib.pyplot.plot` to plot the binned data. You will have to deal with the fact that the counts- and bin-arrays have different lengths. Explain how you deal with this problem and why.\n",
    "* Binning integers\n",
    "  * But binning real numbers into a fixed number of bins is easy when `numpy.histogram` does all the work and finds the right bin boundaries for you. \n",
    "Now we'll generate a bunch of integers and set the bin boundaries manually. This time, let's grab data from a Poisson distribution. As it turns out `numpy` also has some convenient random number generators. Use `numpy.random.poisson` to generate 5000 numbers drawn from a Poisson distribution characterized by $\\lambda = 10$. Find the maximum and minimum value of your 5000 random numbers. \n",
    "  * Instead of simplify specifying the number of bins for `numpy.histogram`, let's specify the bins we want using a vector. Create a vector $v$ that results in a binning that puts each integer value in its own bin and where the first bin contains the minimum number you found above, and the last bin contains the maximum number (you may want to think about how `numpy.histogram` deals with the smallest an largest value in particular; is it correct to set the first entry of $v$ to be equal to the smallest value you observe and the last entry of $v$ to be the highest value observed?). Use the vector by setting `numpy.histogram`'s `bin` parameter as `bin = ` $v$. What is the sum over bin counts? Explain how the binning-vectors first and last element relates to the min and max from the Poisson distribution.\n",
    "  * Now, use a bar chart (`matplotlib.pyplot.bar`) to plot the distribution \n",
    "* Binning and plotting degree distributions. \n",
    "  * Let's generate the Erdös-Renyi (ER) network which has a degree distribution that matches the Poisson distribution above. \n",
    "First we have to figure out which values the ER parameters (_N_ and _p_) should assume. It's easy to see that $N = 5000$, but how do you find $p$? \n",
    "**Hint**: The parameter $\\lambda$ in the Poisson distribution corresponds to the average degree, so you have to find a $p$ that results in an average degree, $k = 10$. And you know that $\\langle k \\rangle = p (N-1)$, which will give you $p$.\n",
    "  * Now, use `networkx` to create the graph and extract the degree distribution.\n",
    "  * Finally, create a nice bar plot of the degree distribution, including axes labels and a plot title. Make sure that it looks like the Poisson distribution you plotted above."

This paradox states that _almost everyone_ have fewer friends than their friends have, on average. This sounds crazy, but is actually an almost trivial consequence of living in a social network with a power-law degree distribution.

Do the following:\n",
